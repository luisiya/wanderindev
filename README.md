# Hello:wave:, and welcome to my GitHub profile!


Hi! I'm **Javier Feliu**, a **full-stack web developer** from Panama City, Panama.  I consider myself a *curious* and *self-directed* individual.  
These qualities make an excellent match for web development, which requires mastering the basics while staying on top of constantly changing trends.

## What's my development setup?

-   :computer: My laptop runs on **Windows 10 Pro**
-   :man_technologist: For my terminal, I user **Ubuntu 18.04** running on **WSL**.
-   :hammer_and_wrench: For IDEs, I use **PyCharm**, **WebStorm**, and **DataGrip** for back-end, front-end, and database work, respectively. I always use **Postman** when working on RESTful APIs.
-   :whale: For containerization, I use **Docker**.
-   :elephant: For databases, I mainly use **PostgreSQL**.
-   :ocean: Currently, I deploy all my projects to a **Kubernetes** cluster running on **DigitalOcean**.

## What's my typical coding day?

-   :snake: If working on a back-end, I would most likely be coding a RESTful API to perform CRUD on a PostgreSQL database. I would use **Python** with **Flask**, **SQLAlchemy**, **Marshmallow**, **JWT-Extended**, and **UnitTest**.
-   :cup_with_straw: If working on a front-end, I would most likely use **jQuery** for DOM manipulation, **Nunjucks** for templating, **Bulma** for styling, and **Gulp** for workflow automation.

## What am I working on?

-   :muscle: I'm coding a RESTful API for a **multitenant online store**. Check out the repository [here](https://github.com/wanderindev/igshop-api).

## What am I blogging about?

-   :bulb: I'm working on a series of articles exploring the topic of **relational database design for full-stack developers**.
-   :dart: Visit my blog, **Wander In Dev**, [here](https://wanderin.dev).

## What am I currently learning?

-  :date: I'm reading the **Kendo UI** [documentation](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/introduction). I will be using its components for the multitenant online store front-end.
-  :loud_sound: I'm also going over a **React** [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) on Udemy.
